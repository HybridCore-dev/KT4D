    "title": "How the Democracy Demonstrator works?",
    "text": "The Democracy Demonstrator begins by guiding users through a 30-question quiz designed to assess their perspectives on the topic. Based on their responses, users are assigned one of eight pre-determined profiles, such as \"Market Proponent.\" After determining the user’s profile, they proceed to a prompt interface where they can submit specific prompts. The platform integrates ChatGPT to generate responses, while utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to pull relevant information from a curated set of 30 documents, including EU policy papers, newspaper articles, and peer-reviewed journal papers. By combining the user’s profile, distribution of the profiles entered to the session, their prompt, and the retrieved data, the system generates a personalized, single-page policy paper that reflects both the user's perspective and evidence-based insights from authoritative sources."
