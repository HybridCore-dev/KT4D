# KT4D-Digital Democracy Demonstrator

The Digital Democracy Demonstrator (DDD), developed by Hybrid Core as part of the EU-funded Horizon Europe KT4D project, is a software platform designed to explore the integration of AI and Big Data in democratic processes while addressing ethical, legal, and cultural challenges. The DDD facilitates hands-on engagement with democratic AI governance, emphasizing the concept of "meaningful frictions" to ensure responsible and transparent civic technology. 

The KT4D project strives to bridge cultural studies with software design to develop tools, guidelines, and frameworks that promote ethical AI use and empower digitally engaged citizens. DDD is still in development, and this repo will be updated to reflect future changes. For more information about, KT4D project, vist https://kt4democracy.eu/
